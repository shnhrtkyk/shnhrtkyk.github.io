Hi ðŸ‘‹

About me
======
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Facebook AI Research. I received my Ph.D. from Stanford University (Stanford AI Lab and Geometric Computation Group), advised by Professor Leonidas J. Guibas. Prior to joining Stanford, I got my B.E. in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University.

My research focuses on deep learning, computer vision and 3D. One of my major projects is to develop novel deep learning architectures for 3D data (point clouds, volumetric grids and multi-view images) and to apply them to perception tasks such as object classification, part segmentation, semantic scene parsing and 3D object detection etc. I have also worked on how to smartly generate large-scale synthetic dataset for training deep convolutional networks, such that the trained deep networks generalize to unseen real data, and even outperform those trained on (smaller scale) real data.
