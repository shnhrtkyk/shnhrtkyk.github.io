* This paper presents a novel semantic segmentation method for spatially distributed full-waveform lidar data observed from an ALS using an PointNet-based architecture called FWNet. 
* The results demonstrate high f1 scores for test data.
* Moreover, the FWNet can deal with dilecctly full-waveform lidar data without any conversison proces mapping into 2D image or 3D voxels.
