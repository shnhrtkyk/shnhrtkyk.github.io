* This paper presents a novel semantic segmentation model for full-waveform lidar data observed from an ALS. 

* The results demonstrate a generalization error for invisible test data.
* Moreover, the FWNetAE encoded a meaningful latent vector and the decoders reconstructed the spatial geometry and its waveform value from the encoded latent vector.
