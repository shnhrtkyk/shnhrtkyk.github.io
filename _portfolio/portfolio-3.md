* We introduce a novel waveform-aware convolutional methodthat directly applies convolutions on irregular full-waveformLiDAR data to extract waveform features.+  We develop an encoder-decoder-based network with a globalmodule including downsampling and upsampling blockswith a skip connection and waveform-aware convolutionaloperations and a local module with only waveform-awareconvolutional operations.+ We eliminate the requirement of expensive calculations ofhandcrafted features and achieve superior performance on abenchmark dataset without any conversion of full-waveformLiDAR data to 2D images or voxels
