* This paper presents a novel representation learning method for spatially distributed full-waveform data observed from an ALS using an AE-based architecture called FWNetAE. 

* The results demonstrate a generalization error for invisible test data.
* Moreover, the FWNetAE encoded a meaningful latent vector and the decoders reconstructed the spatial geometry and its waveform value from the encoded latent vector.
